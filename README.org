** Long-term Roadmap:

Some of these are far more pie-in-the-sky than others. I think
that all of them would be cool to have though.

- [ ] Create a wrapper script that can be used from the command line
- [ ] Write an EIEIO class for packages
- [ ] Allow for packages to be defined via S-Expressions
- [ ] Make a TUI/Menu for installing/upgrading packages
- [ ] Be able to build GUIX derivations
- [ ] Port to Common Lisp
- [ ] Rename to kisp? (once ported to Common Lisp)
