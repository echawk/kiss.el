;;; Commentary:

;; kiss.el is an implementation of the
;; KISS Linux package manager (https://codeberg.org/kiss-community/kiss)
;; This package can also be thought of as providing an "API" into
;; the kiss package system since, at the moment, the only way to do
;; any interesting computation with the kiss package system is to
;; parse and write everything yourself.

;; My hope is that the publishing and finishing of kiss.el will inspire
;; others to write their own implementations of kiss.

;; TODO: see if I can reduce the required Emacs version.

;; TODO: go through and mark functions as being pure or side-effect free if
;; they are, as it could improve the performance when byte compiled.

;; NOTE: IMPORTANT ~ If I want to properly support darwin as an OS
;; I will need to properly get group information for each user, since
;; at least on macOS, each user is (generally) part of the staff group.
;; see here: https://superuser.com/questions/590683/how-do-i-find-my-user-id-and-group-in-mac-os-x#590691

;; WHY??? - cuz it's good to have multiple implementations of kiss.
;; also, I don't want to leave Emacs, and this could lead to some
;; delcarative configurations of kiss.

;; Need to figure out what exactly to support - I'm thinking of
;; having a subset of kiss' features supported, primarily enough
;; for interactive use, as well as to support a delcarative configuration.
;; Anything else will be out of scope (for the time being).

;; Long term I would like to have a tui/gui for managing kiss
;; packages - something similar to how guix and list-packages works.
;; This would be pretty nice, and ideally I'd like to support the same
;; type of ux as list-packages - mapping all of the common actions to
;; keybinds and whatnot.

;; Additionally, I may add some extensions/configuration specific to this
;; version of kiss.  Nothing that would break compatibilty with upstream kiss,
;; since you should be able to rely on that to fix you system should something
;; break, things such as having a nicer syntax to create your KISS_PATH,
;; the ability to export the settings in here to a shell file that you
;; can use with standard kiss, etc.

;; META-TODO: Need to go through every function and add much more
;; detailed documentation - ideally examples as well as why you
;; might care about the function as well.

;; TODO: add in (message) everywhere!!! This will be espescially
;; useful when there is a cli wrapper for this program.  Having these
;; messages is also useful more generally as it allows you to see what
;; exactly the package manager is doing at any given time.

;; FIXME: in addition to these messages, there also needs to be
;; assertions/error checking done throughout the code.

;; FIXME: need to go through and fixup some of the bulid-install-download
;; logic to ensure that *every* missing dependency is accounted for.
;; Also, need to make sure that they return values which are *sensible*
;; and that can be used for further reasoning.

;; FIXME: generally speaking, we don't do a great job of respecting
;; the potential dependencies of /var/db/kiss/installed/*pkg

;; Also, need to go through this code once I get a fully working POC done
;; and ruthlessly remove all duplicated code, since rn there are many
;; little redundancies spread about the current source.
